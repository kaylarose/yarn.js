{"name":"Yarn.js","body":"### What is yarn.js?\r\n*This little project spawned from a personal dislike of the `[$.deferred API|http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/]` syntax. It is meant to be a very very simple no-frills way to spin off worker processes (either synchronous or asynchronous) and then \"do something\" when they are all finished. \r\n\r\n* I would recommend looking at `$.deferred` or similar if you need something more complex.\r\n\r\n### Using yarn.js\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Fibers (asynchronous worker \"threads\")\r\n```\r\nvar yarn = new Yarn;\r\nvar results = {};\r\nyarn.fiber(function() {\r\n  // Do some heavy processing here .. \r\n  results.threadA = data;\r\n  this.yarn.complete();\r\n});\r\nyarn.fiber(function() {\r\n  // Do service queries here ..\r\n  results.threadB = data;\r\n  this.yarn.complete();\r\n});\r\nyarn.join(function() {\r\n  // Wait for all processes to complete\r\n  // and then process the results....\r\n});\r\n```\r\n### Stacks (synchronous workers)\r\n```\r\n// Add some synchronous anonymous workers\r\nyarn.stack(function() {\r\n  // Do some processing here .. \r\n  this.yarn.complete(firstResult);\r\n},\r\nfunction(firstResult) {\r\n  // Do some processing here ..\r\n  this.yarn.complete(secondResult);\r\n},\r\nfunction(secondResult) {\r\n  // Do some processing here ..\r\n  this.yarn.complete(lastResult);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Dependencies.\r\nyarn.js is written in Vanilla JS, there is not 3rd-party libraries required. yarn.js unit tests are written in QUnit (which is bundled with the src).\r\n\r\n### Possible Future Enhancements\r\n* Web-worker support\r\n* Nested Fibers\r\n* More consistent Stack vs. Fiber Handling\r\n* Late binding of workers\r\n* `$.reject`-type `die()` method for quick-exits.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with yarn.js? Feel free to PM or email me (@kaylarose). Open to contributions/pull-requests. Not tested in IE - but should be compatible. Willing to patch any IE issues asap.","tagline":"Stupid-simple JS Sync and Async Worker \"Threading\"","google":"UA-32118551-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
